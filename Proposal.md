# PROJECT 1 - PROJECT PROPOSAL

## 1) Problem ü§î
### 1.1 Description of Problem Space
Access to legal aid is crucial for ensuring justice and protecting rights, but many young people, immigrants, and marginalized communities face significant barriers when seeking legal help. Three main problems that can be seen as barriers are: complexity and legal jargon, outdated, non-mobile-friendly interfaces, and fear of formal institutions along with a lack of anonymity.
These issues hinder equal access to justice, which is a key focus of UNESCO‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. Addressing these barriers is essential to build inclusive and accessible legal systems for all.

### 1.3 Problem 2: Non-Mobile-Friendly, Outdated Interfaces

In the digital age, **mobile accessibility is essential**‚Äîespecially for young users, marginalized communities, and immigrants who often rely on smartphones as their primary or only means of accessing the internet. However, many official legal aid or reporting websites in Malaysia remain outdated, difficult to navigate on mobile devices, and not optimized for intuitive use.

This creates significant barriers for individuals who may already struggle with **language challenges**, **limited digital literacy**, or **unstable internet access**. During urgent or distressing situations, the inability to quickly and easily access legal help via mobile can result in **delays in justice**, **increased vulnerability**, and a **sense of helplessness**.

A lack of **responsive, mobile-friendly design** effectively excludes the very communities that most need accessible legal support.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The 
<a href="[https://aplikasi.jbg.gov.my/myjanjitemu/index.php#features]"> JBG website</a> is clearly optimized for full-screen desktop viewing. However, when accessed in smaller windows or on mobile devices, it shows significant issues:
> - Images fail to resize properly  
> - Overlapping icons obstruct the text  
> - Layout becomes inconsistent and messy

These problems violate the usability goals of **Accessibility** and **Effectiveness**, as well as the UX goals of being **Accessible** and **Satisfying**.

  <strong>Figure 1.3.3</strong>: Interface of <a href="https://aplikasi.jbg.gov.my/myjanjitemu/index.php#features">MyJanjiTemu</a>
</p>

The **MyJanjiTemu** feature within the JBG website is intended to help users make legal advising appointments. However:

- The top-right menu icon is **non-functional**
- Critical sections like **available services**, **branch locations**, and **FAQs** are inaccessible

This suggests poor maintenance or an unfinished implementation, making the service ineffective in practice.

#### Malaysian Bar Council Website: Text-Heavy & Unengaging

<p align="center">

  <strong>Figure 1.3.4</strong>: Malaysian Bar Council Website UI  
  Source: <a href="https://www.malaysianbar.org.my/">Malaysian Bar</a>
</p>

The **Malaysian Bar Council website** heavily relies on dense blocks of text, minimal graphics, and a bland color scheme, resulting in:

- A **cognitively demanding** experience  
- An interface that is **uninviting** for less literate or younger users

This violates UX principles of being **Enjoyable**, **Motivating**, and **Emotionally Fulfilling**.

### 1.4 Problem 3: Fear of Formal Institutions and Lack of Anonymity

Recently, an AI deepfake scandal at **Foon Yew High School** raised serious concerns about **digital safety** and **trust in institutions**. A female student revealed that her photo was used to generate explicit AI-generated images, which were then sold and distributed online. Despite the seriousness of the case, her request to report the incident to police was rejected by a school authority‚Äîallegedly to protect the school's reputation. The perpetrator received only minor disciplinary action.

  <img src="Blog/Figures/1.4.0.png" width="500"><br>
  <strong>Figure 1.4.0</strong>: A screenshot of the victim‚Äôs statement posted on Instagram
</p>

This case highlights the **fear and mistrust** many victims feel when seeking help from formal institutions. The school‚Äôs passive response and lack of confidentiality discouraged others from coming forward. Only after the incident went viral on social media did more victims‚Äîsome as young as 14‚Äîbegin to share their own experiences.

---

From a **Usability and UX perspective**, this situation reveals major flaws in current reporting systems. The absence of an:

- **Anonymous**
- **Intuitive**
- **Emotionally supportive**

reporting tool created a significant barrier for victims‚Äîespecially young users‚Äîwho feared **stigma**, **judgment**, or **retaliation**.

To address this, UX design should prioritize:

- üõ°Ô∏è **Safety**
- üí¨ **Emotional reassurance**
- üñ±Ô∏è **Ease of use**

These elements are especially crucial for **young**, **digitally vulnerable**, or **first-time** users navigating traumatic experiences.

---

To encourage reporting and protect users, legal aid systems must align with key usability and UX goals:

### Usability Goals:
- **Learnability** ‚Äì Easy to understand for first-time users  
- **Accessibility** ‚Äì Inclusive for users with diverse needs or devices  
- **User Confidence** ‚Äì Instills trust and a sense of control  

### UX Goals:
- **Emotional Satisfaction** ‚Äì Comfort and support during stressful tasks  
- **Trust** ‚Äì Confidential, non-judgmental, and secure user experience  

These principles are essential to design **tools that empower victims to seek help without fear**.
