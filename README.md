21.4.2025 - The debut of SuperIdol5! <br>
<br>
Hey there! We’re SuperIdol5 – a passionate group of five students from the Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru. We came together with one shared mission: to enhance your user experience (UX) and make technology feel more human. 💻✨

You might be wondering: Why the name SuperIdol5? (especially since a few of us don’t exactly have K-pop visuals 😅). Well, the name is actually inspired by the word “SuperIdols,” but with a twist – we replaced the 's' with a ‘5’ to represent our team of five. Simple, catchy, and full of meaning.

But it’s more than just a name.

To us, SuperIdol5 is a reminder that no matter how rough life gets, each of us is still the super idol of our own story. 🌟 And just like any idol who shines on stage, we believe that becoming our best selves requires dedication, hard work, and a determination to grow – qualities that we proudly bring into every project we take on.

So whether it’s brainstorming UX solutions, building interfaces, or just making tech more user-friendly, SuperIdol5 is here to bring creativity, heart, and a touch of sparkle to everything we do.

Stay tuned – because we’re just getting started! 😉
