# Gathering Requirements -  Task Analysis

## Introduction
This task analysis aims to understand how users currently find legal support through existing methods before the development of JustiLink. Users always rely on government websites, translation tools or public forums, but these are not always accessible, user-friendly and privacy protected. Understanding the current limitations is very essential to designing a more effective legal supporting system.

**Task 1: Understanding Personal Legal Rights**

Currently, users struggle with complex legal language on the official website. Many users will rely on translation tools, but often produce unclear and inaccurate results, making users difficult to know their rights.

**Task 2: Finding Legal Help Anonymously** 

Current platforms usually require users' personal information before they can ask questions, which discourages those who fear exposure or judgment.

**Task 3: Accessing Legal Resources through Mobile Devices** 

Many legal aid sites do not focus on mobile use, causing slow load times, poor navigation and high data usage. This makes it difficult for users with basic phones or limited internet access to get the help they need.

### Findings from the HTAs for Task 1
#### 1. Technical Challenges
-Many users face delays due to slow website performance on basic devices.

-Navigation elements often malfunction or fail to respond properly.

-Visual obstructions and layout glitches make it hard to read or interact.

-Device performance issues like overheating or rapid battery drain cut sessions short.

#### 2. User Experience Problems
-Interfaces are poorly adjusted for small screen sizes.

-Disorganized design and dense text reduce readability.

-Users often cannot find or reach the legal information they’re looking for.

#### 3. Emotional and Behavioral Reactions
-Confusion and irritation arise from unclear content and tool limitations.

-Users frequently abandon the process before reaching a solution.

-Negative experiences reduce trust and motivation to seek help again.

#### 4. Barriers to Access
Legal resources do not cater to low-spec devices or unstable internet connections.

Many people are excluded from accessing their rights due to digital limitations.

#### 5. Recommendations
-Create fast, efficient platforms that work well on all types of mobile devices.

-Use clear structure, responsive design, and simplified features.

-Present content in plain language and ensure intuitive navigation for everyone.

### Findings from the HTAs for Task 2
#### 1. Attempts to find help
-Searched social media platforms and forums.

-Scrolled through posts but worried about exposure.

-Started typing a question but hesitated to post.

-Considered community resources, but information was unreliable.

#### 2. Privacy challenges
-Many platforms require personal information.

-The risk of being identified by employers and friends makes the user feel unsafe and hesitant.

-Even “anonymous” online spaces may have digital traces that could be linked back to users.

#### 3. Emotional impact
-Users felt overwhelmed, worried, and frustrated.

-Users eventually gave up on seeking help and feeling unsupported.

#### 4. Recommendations
-Create a platform where users can seek legal advice anonymously, with no mandatory personal information needed.

-Set up anonymous chatbots or helplines with instant responses to common legal questions.

-Transition to more detailed help (if needed) only after the user consents to share information.
