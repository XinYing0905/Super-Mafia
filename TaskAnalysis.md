# Gathering Requirements - Task Analysis

## Introduction

This task analysis aims to understand how users currently find legal support through existing methods before the development of **JustiLink**. Users often rely on government websites, translation tools, or public forums, but these are not always accessible, user-friendly, or privacy-protected. Understanding these limitations is essential to designing a more effective legal support system.

|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Background and Motivation**        | Motivated by personal safety and justice due to bullying, seeks understanding of her rights, uses digital tools comfortably. | Motivated by financial and job security after a work injury, but fears exposure, job loss, and complex processes.       |
| **Platforms and Paths Taken**        | Joan starts with browser searches, explores NGO sites, checks for live chats, and finally posts on forums like Reddit and Quora. | Emma uses social media platforms, tries posting but hesitates and deletes the post, then gives up.                      |
| **Struggles with Privacy and Emotions** | Joan faces uncertainty and confusion when platforms require personal information but still tries alternative forums. | Emma’s privacy concern is stronger—she worries not only about being identified but also about risking her job. This leads her to stop sooner than Joan. |
| **Emotional Journey and Final Outcome** | Feels hesitant but hopeful, continues searching, leaves with saved links, though her questions are unresolved.         | Feels overwhelmed, frustrated, and discouraged, and completely gives up without obtaining any useful information.        |
| **Who Uses the Shortest Path to Reach a Decision?** | Emma takes the shortest route. She moves from seeking information to deciding not to post and closes her laptop. Her journey ends faster due to greater fear of exposure. | Joan takes a longer, more exploratory path, checking multiple online sources, trying to read content, and even saving links. Despite feeling hesitant, she does not completely abandon the task. |

### Similarities
Both the migrant construction worker and the office worker tried to find legal help online by searching on their devices and visiting legal aid websites. Although they used different devices and had different levels of digital skills, they faced similar problems such as slow website loading, difficult navigation, and technical issues. These problems made both users feel frustrated and unhappy, which led them to stop using the websites before finishing their tasks. This shows that no matter what device or background the user has, online legal help platforms need to be easy to use, quick to load, and designed for people with different skills and devices. 

## 📋Design Requirement

The JustiLink system design needs to keep the things users are already familiar with: being able to search for legal information online, through websites, apps, or social media. These platforms help people start learning about their rights and get a sense of what steps they might need to take. But just keeping these isn’t enough. Many users, like Emma, face confusing and complicated systems that leave them feeling overwhelmed.

That’s why we need to introduce new, user-friendly solutions. First, there should be safe, anonymous ways for people to ask questions or seek legal help—whether through a chatbot or a secure hotline—without needing to expose their personal information. The legal information itself needs to be clear, easy to read, and broken down into simple steps, so anyone can understand it. Since many users access these services on their phones, the design has to work well (faster loading, cleaner layouts, and easy-to-use navigation) on all devices, especially on older models with slower internet. Lastly, the system should make it clear how their information is protected and give them choices about what they share, to let people feel safe and in control.
