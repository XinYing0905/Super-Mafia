# Gathering Requirements - Task Analysis

## Introduction

This task analysis aims to understand how users currently find legal support through existing methods before the development of **JustiLink**. Users often rely on government websites, translation tools, or public forums, but these are not always accessible, user-friendly, or privacy-protected. Understanding these limitations is essential to designing a more effective legal support system.

## Comparison of User Interactions in Task 1

| **Aspect**                    | **Joan(High School Student)**                                                                 | **Rahim Uddin(Migrant Construction Worker)**                                               | **Emma(Office Worker)**                                                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Motivation/Context**       | Learning rights due to **personal bullying** experience.                                 | Needs to **sign a work contract** with unclear content.                       | Tries to **claim medical benefits** but fears consequences.                |
| **Digital Literacy**         | Moderate – uses browser, search terms translation.                              | Moderate – uses translation tools but may not explore alternatives.           | Moderate – searches Google, attempts calling helpline.                     |
| **Language Barrier**         | Faces legal jargon, overcomes it with Google Translate and forums.                       | Major barrier – contract is in English/Malay, translation is poor.            | Struggles with legal terms but can read and understand to a basic extent.  |
| **Support-Seeking Behavior** | Proactively searches for forums, NGOs, alternative sources.                              | May avoid help due to fear, uncertainty, or lack of access.                   | Attempts to seek help (calls helpline), but finds it too complex.          |

### Similarities
All three users shared similar goals in Task 1, as they were trying to understand their rights or obligations related to legal or official matters. They all attempted to obtain information using digital platforms such as web searches, translation tools, or online help services. However, each of them encountered barriers when trying to comprehend the formal or legal content, which often contained complex or unfamiliar language. This difficulty caused confusion, uncertainty, and frustration during their search process. Additionally, all users expressed concerns about their privacy and feared exposure, whether due to embarrassment, potential job risks, or the requirement to enter personal data.

## 📊 HTA Comparison for Task 1 and Discussion
There are 3 personas involved in Task 1(Simplified the legal content) which are Joan(a high school student), Rahim Uddin(a migrant construction worker) and Emma(an office worker). Three of them tried to access legal information online regarding bullying laws, worker contract and employee legal rights. However, they face some challenges such as language barriers and complexity of legal jargon content when they are trying to understand their legal standing. The HTA above reveals the different user experiences and challenges.

### Differences
 Joan started her task by searching “bullying law in Malaysia” and browsing various different websites (HTA 2.1→2.2). She clicked the relevant article and struggled to read and understand the legal jargon (HTA 3.3) and finally feeling confused and unsure what the content would like to express (HTA 3.3.2). This highlights the complexity of legal language in the content and support brings the challenge to Joan.This also reflects her limited familiarity with legal content and her dependence on search results to guide her.

Rahim Uddin dealt with the legal content in a bilingual work contract. He used translation tools to struggle understanding the legal terms (HTA 2.1-2.3). However, the awkward translated sentence structure makes him still feeling unsure for the meaning of the content in the contract (HTA 3.1-3.5). Although he was uncertain about the context, he still signed the contract due to desire to earn money for his family (HTA 4.1). This highlighted how the language barriers and translation issues may cause the user to be forced into making uninformed decisions.

In contrast, Emma started her task by searching for rights or information about medical claims. When she was reading the content, she found that there was too much complicated legal language and still confused and unable to totally understand her right(HTA 1.2.1-1.2.3). She decided to seek additional help such as contacting the labour department(HTA 2). However, the too long process, too much documents required incurs the perceived complexity which causing her decided to give up (HTA 2.2-3.1).

### Similarities
All three users tried to understand their legal information whether by reading articles, using online tools or contacting authorities. In the end, none of them completed their task with clarity and confidence. Hence, these 3 HTA above showed the current legal content formats fail to serve users with language proficiency and legal knowledge.

### Design Implications
According to the HTA findings, we conclude the improvements and the features that are worth retaining to ensure the platforms is user friendly for different users with mastering different languages and legal knowledge

Improvement needed:
- Simplified legal content by using simple language and making them in clearer visual structure to prevent the complex legal jargon. Hence, all the users may easy to understand the content

- Support the multilingual and ensure its accurate and in relevant translations so that users with varying different languages skills may access the legal information

Features to keep:

- Maintain the simple and clean interface to ensure the users may navigate easily

- Keep font sizes are accessible and high contrast to improve readability

## Comparison of User Interactions in Task 2
| Aspect                              | Joan (High-School Student)                                                                                       | Emma (Office Worker)                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Background and Motivation**        | Motivated by personal safety and justice due to bullying, seeks understanding of her rights, uses digital tools comfortably. | Motivated by financial and job security after a work injury, but fears exposure, job loss, and complex processes.       |
| **Platforms and Paths Taken**        | Joan starts with browser searches, explores NGO sites, checks for live chats, and finally posts on forums like Reddit and Quora. | Emma uses social media platforms, tries posting but hesitates and deletes the post, then gives up.                      |
| **Struggles with Privacy and Emotions** | Joan faces uncertainty and confusion when platforms require personal information but still tries alternative forums. | Emma’s privacy concern is stronger—she worries not only about being identified but also about risking her job. This leads her to stop sooner than Joan. |
| **Emotional Journey and Final Outcome** | Feels hesitant but hopeful, continues searching, leaves with saved links, though her questions are unresolved.         | Feels overwhelmed, frustrated, and discouraged, and completely gives up without obtaining any useful information.        |
| **Who Uses the Shortest Path to Reach a Decision?** | Emma takes the shortest route. She moves from seeking information to deciding not to post and closes her laptop. Her journey ends faster due to greater fear of exposure. | Joan takes a longer, more exploratory path, checking multiple online sources, trying to read content, and even saving links. Despite feeling hesitant, she does not completely abandon the task. |

### Similarities
Both Joan and Emma faced privacy worries when platforms asked for personal details. Neither was able to get clear, trustworthy advice anonymously. They both felt confused, frustrated, and ended their searches without answers.

# 📊 HTA Comparison for Task 2 and Discussion

There are 2 personas involved in Task 2 (Anonymous First Chat Feature) which are Joan(a high school student) and Emma (an office worker). Both of them tried to find anonymous features to seek legal advice online but their decision-making processes are different due to privacy concerns.

### Differences
Joan started her task by looking for legal help about bullying by using a browser. She tried to read the content that has a similar situation with her but finally decided to look for platforms to ask legal questions anonymously. She explored various NGO websites and checked for chat or email options but finally did not choose this option due to privacy concerns (HTA 2.1→2.3). Then she turned to online communities like Reddit or Quora  to post her legal question anonymously for obtaining answers(HTA 3.1→3.3). She used various platforms that required personal information and felt uncertain showing that she was willing to try informal sources instead of the formal one to ensure her identity will not be revealed.

Emma started her task with looking for a social media platform for learning and understanding medical claims(HTA 1.1→2.1). She typed a question asking for help (step 3.1), but after hesitating due to fear of being identified and risking her job, she deleted the post and exited (step 3.3 → 4.1). Her HTA path was shorter, and she disengaged faster compared to Joan, showing that privacy anxiety had a stronger impact on her actions.

### Similarities
Both users struggled with platforms requiring personal information, which made them feel exposed and vulnerable (HTA step 2.3.1 and 3.2). Despite using different platforms, they both failed to find a trusted, truly anonymous legal advice source. Their experiences reflected emotional states like worry, confusion, and frustration, leading both of them to end the task without getting the help they needed. These patterns suggest that current digital tools are not designed well for users seeking anonymous legal guidance.

### Design Implications
HTA analysis suggests several areas for improvement while also highlighting elements that should be preserved.

Improvement needed:

- Provide anonymous communication channels (e.g., chatbots or masked emails) to protect user privacy.

- Introduce step-by-step guidance and reduce sign-up barriers to improve user trust and comfort.

Features to keep:

- Preserve clear privacy policy statements to reassure users about data protection.

- Retain current features that guide users toward reliable legal sources without overwhelming legal jargon.

# Comparison of User Interactions in Task 3
 | Aspect                               |  Rahim Uddin(Migrant Construction Worker)                                                    | Emma(Office Worker)                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Background & Motivation**          | Rahim Uddin uses basic phone user limited data to seek legal rights information              | Emma uses budget smartphone user on public Wi-Fi to seek employee legal help                          |
| **Starting Point**                   | Rahim Uddin starts with searching “legal rights” via mobile browser                                      | Emma starts with searching “employee legal help Malaysia” via browser                                        |
| **Interaction & Emotional Response** | Faces slow loading and confusing navigation; quickly frustrated and exits early | Encounters lag, unresponsive buttons, and pop-ups; frustrated but persists before quitting |
| **Main Challenges**                  | Device limitations, low digital literacy, slow site performance                 | Poor UI design, lag, device overheating, and battery drain                                 |

### Similarities
Both the migrant construction worker and the office worker tried to find legal help online by searching on their devices and visiting legal aid websites. Although they used different devices and had different levels of digital skills, they faced similar problems such as slow website loading, difficult navigation, and technical issues. These problems made both users feel frustrated and unhappy, which led them to stop using the websites before finishing their tasks. This shows that no matter what device or background the user has, online legal help platforms need to be easy to use, quick to load, and designed for people with different skills and devices. 

# 📊 HTA Comparison for Task 3 and Discussion

Task 3 involved two personas: the Rahim Uddin,a migrant construction worker and Emma,the office worker, both attempting to find legal help through their mobile devices. Although they shared the same goal, their experiences differed due to factors such as digital literacy, device limitations, and interface usability.
### Differences

Rahim Uddin searched for legal rights using his mobile phone and tried to access a legal aid website. According to his HTA, he navigated the site briefly but gave up after experiencing slow page loading and difficulty scrolling (HTA step 2.2.3 → 3.1). This shows that he may have limited experience with online platforms and quickly disengages when the interface is not responsive.

In contrast, Emma demonstrated more digital confidence. She first connected to public Wi-Fi before searching for employee legal help (HTA step 1 → 2). Although she encountered various interface issues such as pop-up interruptions and unresponsive buttons (step 3.4 → 3.5), she still made several attempts to interact with the content before exiting. This indicates that she was more persistent but still hindered by poor design and usability on her budget smartphone.

### Similarities

Despite their differences, both users encountered challenges that led them to abandon the task. They both faced long loading times (HTA 3.1), cluttered layout (4.1), and frustration with unresponsive website elements. Neither user was able to complete their goal of finding useful legal help, highlighting usability issues that affect users across different backgrounds.

### Design Implications
Insights from the HTA show what should be improved and what already works well for users with varying digital literacy levels.

Improvement needed:

- Prioritize fast loading speeds and responsive design, especially for low-end devices.

- Reduce distractions, such as pop-ups and unresponsive interface elements.

Features to keep:

- Maintain the straightforward and lightweight system design that suits users with limited technical skills.

- Continue ensuring compatibility across a variety of devices to support diverse user needs.




## 📋Design Requirements

The JustiLink system design needs to keep the things users are already familiar with: being able to search for legal information online, through websites, apps, or social media. These platforms help people start learning about their rights and get a sense of what steps they might need to take. But just keeping these isn’t enough. Many users, like Emma, face confusing and complicated systems that leave them feeling overwhelmed.

That’s why we need to introduce new, user-friendly solutions. First, there should be safe, anonymous ways for people to ask questions or seek legal help—whether through a chatbot or a secure hotline—without needing to expose their personal information. The legal information itself needs to be clear, easy to read, and broken down into simple steps, so anyone can understand it. Since many users access these services on their phones, the design has to work well (faster loading, cleaner layouts, and easy-to-use navigation) on all devices, especially on older models with slower internet. Lastly, the system should make it clear how their information is protected and give them choices about what they share, to let people feel safe and in control.
