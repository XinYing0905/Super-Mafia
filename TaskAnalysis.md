# Gathering Requirements - Task Analysis

## Introduction

This task analysis aims to understand how users currently find legal support through existing methods before the development of **JustiLink**. Users often rely on government websites, translation tools, or public forums, but these are not always accessible, user-friendly, or privacy-protected. Understanding these limitations is essential to designing a more effective legal support system.
