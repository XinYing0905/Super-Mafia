## PROJECT 1 - PROJECT PROPOSAL

## 1) Problem 🤔
{Description of Problem Space
Access to legal aid is crucial for ensuring justice and protecting rights, but many young people, immigrants, and marginalized communities face significant barriers when seeking legal help. Three main problems that can be seen as barriers are: complexity and legal jargon, outdated, non-mobile-friendly interfaces, and fear of formal institutions along with a lack of anonymity.
These issues hinder equal access to justice, which is a key focus of UNESCO’s Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. Addressing these barriers is essential to build inclusive and accessible legal systems for all.}
