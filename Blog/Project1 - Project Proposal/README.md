## PROJECT 1 - PROJECT PROPOSAL

## 1) Problem ü§î
## 1.1 Description of Problem Space
Access to legal aid is crucial for ensuring justice and protecting rights, but many young people, immigrants, and marginalized communities face significant barriers when seeking legal help. Three main problems that can be seen as barriers are: complexity and legal jargon, outdated, non-mobile-friendly interfaces, and fear of formal institutions along with a lack of anonymity.
These issues hinder equal access to justice, which is a key focus of UNESCO‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. Addressing these barriers is essential to build inclusive and accessible legal systems for all.

## 1.3 Problem 2: Non-Mobile-Friendly, Outdated Interfaces
In the digital age, mobile accessibility is essential‚Äîespecially for young users, marginalized communities, and immigrants who often rely on smartphones as their primary or only means of accessing the internet. However, many official legal aid or reporting websites in Malaysia remain outdated, difficult to navigate on mobile devices, and not optimized for intuitive use. This creates significant barriers for individuals who may already struggle with language challenges, limited digital literacy, or unstable internet access. For these users, particularly during urgent or distressing situations, the inability to quickly and easily access legal help via mobile can result in delays in justice, increased vulnerability, and a sense of helplessness. A lack of responsive, mobile-friendly design effectively excludes the very communities that most need accessible legal support.

### Desktop vs Mobile View ‚Äì Jabatan Bantuan Guaman (JBG) Website

**Figure 1.3.2. Mobile view of JBG website**

The Jabatan Bantuan Guaman Malaysia (JBG) website is clearly optimized for full-screen desktop viewing. However, when accessed in a resized browser window or on a mobile device, the site exhibits significant usability issues. In the mini-window view, images do not resize appropriately, and in mobile view, overlapping icons obstruct the text while the layout becomes inconsistent and disorganized.

These problems violate the usability goals of **Accessibility** and **Effectiveness**, which stress that information should be easily viewable on smartphones, with large touch targets and clear navigation. The site also fails to meet UX goals of being **Accessible** and **Satisfying**, as it does not deliver a smooth, pleasant experience across devices.

### MyJanjiTemu Interface Issues

**Figure 1.3.3. Interface of MyJanjiTemu**

Within the JBG website, the **MyJanjiTemu** feature is designed to allow users to make legal advising appointments. However, the top-right directory button is non-functional, suggesting that the feature is either incomplete or poorly maintained. As a result, users cannot access essential services like checking available services, branch locations, office hours, or an FAQ section.

### Malaysian Bar Council Website

**Figure 1.3.4. Interfaces of Malaysian Bar Council (Badan Peguam Malaysia)**  
*Source: [Malaysian Bar](https://www.malaysianbar.org.my/)*

The Malaysian Bar Council website relies heavily on dense text, minimal visuals, and a limited color palette. This contributes to a dry, cognitively demanding user interface that is not engaging for young or less literate users. This contradicts key UX goals such as being **Enjoyable**, **Cognitively Stimulating**, **Emotionally Fulfilling**, and **Motivating**.

## 1.4 Problem 3: Fear of Formal Institutions and Lack of Anonymity

Recently, an AI deepfake scandal at Foon Yew High School raised serious concerns about digital safety and trust in institutions. A female student revealed that her photo was used to generate explicit AI-generated images, which were sold and distributed online. Despite the severity of the case, her request to report the incident to police was rejected by a school authority‚Äîallegedly to protect the school's reputation. The perpetrator received only minor disciplinary action.

![Screenshot of victim‚Äôs statement](Blog/Figures/1.0.png)  
**Figure 1.4.0 A screenshot of a victim‚Äôs statement posted on Instagram**

This case highlights the fear and mistrust many victims feel when seeking help from formal institutions. The school‚Äôs passive response and lack of confidentiality discouraged others from coming forward. Only after the incident went viral on social media did more victims‚Äîsome as young as 14‚Äîshare their experiences.

From a **Usability and UX** perspective, this reveals major flaws in current reporting systems. The absence of an **anonymous**, **intuitive**, and **emotionally supportive** reporting tool created a barrier for victims who feared stigma or retaliation. UX design in this context should focus on **safety**, **emotional reassurance**, and **ease of use**, particularly for young or vulnerable users.

To encourage reporting and protect users, legal aid systems must align with usability goals such as **Learnability**, **Accessibility**, and **User Confidence**, and UX goals like **Emotional Satisfaction** and **Trust**. These principles are essential to build tools that empower users to seek help without fear.
