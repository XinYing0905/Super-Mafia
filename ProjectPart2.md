# User Analysis â€“ Gathering Requirements

## Introduction
The user analysis phase focuses on understanding the needs, behaviors, and pain points of various user groups who could benefit from **JustiLink**. To achieve this, three user personas have been developed, each representing one of our target audiences. These personas help guide the development of a user-centered platform by highlighting specific user goals and challenges.

## Proposed Tasks
To build a helpful and accessible platform for individuals facing legal challenges, **three core tasks** have been identified for JustiLink:

### 1. Understand Legal Content in Simple Language
Many individuals lack formal legal education and struggle to comprehend complex legal jargon. This task focuses on simplifying legal information so that users from all backgroundsâ€”including those affected by workplace discrimination, school bullying, or unsafe working conditionsâ€”can understand their rights in clear, straightforward terms.

### 2. Obtain Legal Guidance Through Anonymous Chat
For sensitive or personal situations, anonymity is crucial. This task allows users to seek legal advice and assistance confidentially through an anonymous chat feature. It is especially helpful for those who fear stigma, retaliation, or breaches of privacy. Users can get the support they need without revealing their identity.

### 3. Access Legal Aid Resources via Mobile Platform
To ensure accessibility and convenience, JustiLink is designed to be fully functional on basic smartphones. This task supports users who may need quick legal information during breaks or in emergency situations. With an intuitive interface, clear icons, and organized categories, users can easily navigate the platform to find relevant legal aid resources anytime, anywhere.

She seeks a safe, anonymous environment where she can speak up without fear of backlash or shame. Joan values transparency, emotional safety, and justice.

</p>

Rahim Uddin is a 28-year-old migrant worker from Bangladesh working as a welder at a construction site in Malaysia. He moved abroad to provide a better future for his wife and two children. Living in a shared dormitory and working long hours, Rahim faces language barriers daily, with limited proficiency in English and Malay. He often signs documents and contracts without fully understanding them and fears being taken advantage of or deported due to misunderstandings.

Rahimâ€™s core motivation is to stay legally employed and send money back to his family, but he feels powerless when confronted with complex legal jargon. He has been ignored when asking for help in the past and hesitates to seek assistance again.

</p>

Emma is a 23-year-old low-income office worker living in a low-cost housing area. She completed secondary school but couldnâ€™t afford higher education. Despite being dedicated and hardworking, Emma has experienced several workplace injusticesâ€”like delayed payments and being forced to work while sick. She uses a basic smartphone and public Wi-Fi, making her heavily reliant on clear, fast-loading platforms that work well under constrained conditions.

Emma wants to stand up for herself and others like her but is afraid of losing her job or being targeted for speaking out. Sheâ€™s tried using legal websites, but the content is too technical, and she often gives up. **JustiLink** offers her a sense of empowerment through its plain-language responses, anonymous chat, and ease of access. She feels validated and informed when she uses the platformâ€”finally able to understand her rights without putting herself at risk.
