# User Analysis – Gathering Requirements

## Introduction
The user analysis phase focuses on understanding the needs, behaviors, and pain points of various user groups who could benefit from **JustiLink**. To achieve this, three user personas have been developed, each representing one of our target audiences. These personas help guide the development of a user-centered platform by highlighting specific user goals and challenges.

## Proposed Tasks
To build a helpful and accessible platform for individuals facing legal challenges, **three core tasks** have been identified for JustiLink:

### 1. Understand Legal Content in Simple Language
Many individuals lack formal legal education and struggle to comprehend complex legal jargon. This task focuses on simplifying legal information so that users from all backgrounds—including those affected by workplace discrimination, school bullying, or unsafe working conditions—can understand their rights in clear, straightforward terms.

### 2. Obtain Legal Guidance Through Anonymous Chat
For sensitive or personal situations, anonymity is crucial. This task allows users to seek legal advice and assistance confidentially through an anonymous chat feature. It is especially helpful for those who fear stigma, retaliation, or breaches of privacy. Users can get the support they need without revealing their identity.

### 3. Access Legal Aid Resources via Mobile Platform
To ensure accessibility and convenience, JustiLink is designed to be fully functional on basic smartphones. This task supports users who may need quick legal information during breaks or in emergency situations. With an intuitive interface, clear icons, and organized categories, users can easily navigate the platform to find relevant legal aid resources anytime, anywhere.
