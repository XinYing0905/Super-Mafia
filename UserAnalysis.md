# 📘 Scenario

## 👩 Persona: Joan – High School Student  
### 🧩 Task 1: Simplified Legal Content

Joan is a secondary school student dealing with bullying. While teachers encourage students to “report it,” Joan isn’t sure what that actually means—or what her rights are in such situations. She goes online and searches for information about bullying laws, hoping to find something helpful. But the websites she visits are filled with long explanations and formal legal terms that are difficult to understand. She tries using an online translation tool to simplify the content, but the results are confusing and often don’t make sense.

Feeling overwhelmed and discouraged, Joan still doesn’t know whether her situation is protected under the law or how to report it properly. Although the information exists, it’s not written in a way that someone her age can easily grasp. This scenario highlights the need for legal information to be rewritten in plain, student-friendly language—using clear explanations, visual guides, and relatable examples so young people like Joan can understand their rights and take action with confidence.

---

### 💬 Task 2: Anonymous First Chat Feature

After reading legal content online, Joan still has personal questions about how her school is handling her bullying case. She wants to ask someone directly whether the school is following proper procedure—but she doesn’t feel ready to share her name or personal details. When she tries to get help through a legal aid website, the platform asks for her full name and identification number before she can even ask a question. Feeling exposed and anxious, she exits the page immediately.

Joan considers using online forums or social media to ask anonymously, but she worries that her questions might be ignored, misinterpreted, or seen by people she knows. She wants a private way to reach out—without fear of being judged or identified. This scenario reflects the need for an anonymous first chat feature, where users can ask sensitive legal questions securely and without pressure. It allows people like Joan to seek the help they need without sacrificing their privacy or emotional safety.

## 👷 Persona: Rahim Uddin – Migrant Construction Worker  
### 🧩 Task 1: Simplified Legal Content

Rahim receives a new employment contract written entirely in English and Malay—languages he is not fluent in. Alone with the document, he flips through the pages with a puzzled expression, trying to make sense of unfamiliar legal terms. Unsure about important clauses such as termination rights, he mutters, “Can they fire me for no reason?” Hoping for clarity, he uses a translation app on his phone and scans parts of the contract. The results are awkward, filled with broken sentences and unclear meanings that only add to his confusion.

With no one to clearly explain the contract and lacking confidence in the translation, Rahim hesitates. Still uncertain, he signs the document anyway, feeling uneasy about what he might have agreed to. This scenario highlights the struggle many users face when dealing with legal content that is not accessible in their native language. It emphasizes the need for legal information to be rewritten in plain, simple terms—supported by visuals and multilingual explanations—to ensure that every user can understand their rights before making important decisions.

---

### 📱 Task 3: Mobile-First, User-Centered Interface

Rahim wants to understand his rights as a worker, so he turns to his phone to search for answers. He types a relevant phrase into a search engine and taps on a legal aid website. The page takes a long time to load, and when it finally appears, the interface is not suited for mobile use. The text is small, buttons are hard to press, and navigating the site feels frustrating. The content is presented in a slide-based format, but every time Rahim presses the “Next” button, the slide takes several seconds to appear, making it difficult to follow.

After repeated delays and interruptions, Rahim becomes visibly frustrated and eventually puts his phone away without finding the information he needs. This scenario reflects the challenges many users face when accessing legal support from mobile devices. It demonstrates the need for a mobile-first platform with responsive design, quick loading times, and simple navigation that meets the needs of users who rely on their phones as their main source of digital access.

## 💼 Persona: Emma – Low-Income Office Worker  
### 🧩 Task 1: Simplified Legal Content

Emma, a part-time retail worker, injured her hand after being assigned repetitive tasks without sufficient breaks. Seeking help for the high cost of her clinic treatment, she opened her laptop and searched for information about employer medical claims. She found several official sites but was quickly overwhelmed by the complicated legal language and technical terms. Despite spending time trying to understand the content, she still wasn’t sure whether her situation qualified for a claim or how to begin the process.
Hoping to get more direct answers, Emma called the labour department’s helpline. But instead of guidance, she was told she needed multiple certified documents to proceed—without any clear explanation of what they were or how to get them. Feeling confused and intimidated, especially without any legal background, Emma gave up. This scenario highlights the need for clear, accessible legal content and simplified claim instructions—delivered in plain language with visual guides and practical examples to help non-experts like Emma take action with confidence.

---

### 💬 Task 2: Anonymous First Chat Feature

Emma has been experiencing unfair treatment from her boss at work, including being assigned the least desirable shifts and receiving harsh criticism without reason. These incidents have left her feeling anxious and unsure about her rights. Wanting to speak up and find out what she can do, Emma turns to a popular social media platform to express her thoughts and seek advice from others. She begins typing a post about her situation, hoping someone might understand or point her in the right direction.
However, as she re-reads what she’s written, a wave of doubt sets in. She worries that her post might be seen by coworkers—or worse, her employer—and fears it could cost her the job she depends on. Out of fear, she deletes the post and decides not to share anything at all. Emma closes her device, feeling isolated and helpless, with no safe space to talk about what’s happening. This scenario reflects the urgent need for an anonymous first chat feature, where workers like Emma can privately ask questions, seek support, and get the guidance they need without the fear of being identified or judged.

### 📱 Task 3: Mobile-First, User-Centered Interface

Emma is a young office worker trying to find legal help after being unfairly asked to work even while taking sick leave from a doctor. She connects to free public Wi-Fi using her basic smartphone and searches for “employee legal help Malaysia.” A legal aid website appears in the search results, but when she taps the link, the page takes a long time to load. Once it opens, Emma struggles to read the dense text and navigate the cluttered layout. The site doesn’t allow zooming, some buttons don’t respond, and a persistent pop-up blocks part of the screen. As she scrolls, the phone starts to heat up, and the lag becomes unbearable.

Frustrated and worried about battery life and data usage, Emma closes the website without getting the help she needed. She thinks, “Why does it need so much data just to load a page?” and gives up trying to use online legal platforms altogether. This scenario highlights the need for a mobile-first, user-centered interface that works well on low-end phones and slow internet connections. Legal websites should be lightweight, responsive, and easy to use—ensuring that people like Emma can access justice without being limited by their device or data plan.
